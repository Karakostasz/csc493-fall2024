## Description/Motivation

#Your formally written project proposal description, and why it is useful/interesting/fun goes here. Try to be as descriptive as possible, as we will be discussing your project ideas during the brainstorming in class.

"
I am a son of a farmer and have worked on a fourth-generation farm since my early years. As I grew up, I could identify that many processes could become efficient. However, I could not produce those solutions most of the time due to a lack of resources as well as knowledge. 

This project intends to create a gadget that constantly measures the distance between two points and sends notifications to your phone through a SIM card. Its purpose is to be attached to special irrigation systems used in Greece as well as other countries. This irrigation system are big metal structures with wheels and are hitched to a tractor, once at the appropriate position for wearing, it is stationed in the ground. The irrigation system resembles large reels that hold about 200 meters of an f90-f130 wide hose through which water runs. The hose is pulled across the field and has a water launcher at the end of it that rotates and throws water to distances ranging from 50-20 meters depending on pressures, hose width, or launcher tube width. This system, once installed in the field and initiated, it starts reeling the hose to its base metal structure, with a speed that can range from 3m/hr to 25m/hr. Farmers evaluate how much watering the field needs and calculate the system's speed with their DIY techniques so that they know what time it will be fully reeled in order to go back to the field and shut it off. 

The issues that arise are many and can have a detrimental impact on farmers. Greece's farming lands are characterized by multiple, small-sized field distributions. This implies that farmers may own many fields of small acreage with great distance from one another.
